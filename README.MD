==========
## Compiling Go libraries & code into Haxe
### [Targets](https://haxe.org/documentation/introduction/compiler-targets.html): Js, Lua, C#, C++, Java, C, Python

* Plug and play support for Haxe & Go.
* Human-like small generated output.
* Leverage Haxe libraries from Go (*coming soon*)



**warning:** *heavily experimental still a ways to go before an alpha*

# Getting started
* Download Golang [here](https://golang.org/dl/)
* Download lix with npm: ``npm install lix -g``
* Installing go2hx: ``lix install https://github.com/pxshadow/go2hx --global``
* Building: ``lix run go2hx ./main.go`` or ``lix run go2hx github.com/tidwall/btree``

## Aknowledgement

A spiritual successor to Tardisgo written by [Elliott Stoneham](https://github.com/elliott5), The developer that has set the building blocks conceptually for this project, as well as a code contributor, with use of some of his code from Tardisgo.

## Code Overview

* The packages are generated by arguments and flags, and exported out from the Go side by json.
* The Haxe side then reads the exported data and begins typing up the data into TypeDefinitions, Fields, and Exprs.
* The types are generated into Haxe files.
* The generated code uses the stdgo package, that contains the basic types, builtin functions, and some macro magic.
