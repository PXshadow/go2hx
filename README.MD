go2hx
==========
The goal, to bring as many possible Go libraries to Haxe, easy integration, usage and modification in Haxe.

A spiritual successor to Tardisgo written by [Elliott Stoneham](https://github.com/elliott5), The developer that has set the building blocks conceptually for this project, as well as a code contributor, with use of some of his code from Tardisgo.

**warning:** *experimental and still very much a work in progress.*

# Getting started
* if you don't have Golang download it [here](https://golang.org/dl/)
* if you don't have lix run: ``npm install lix -g``
* ``lix install https://github.com/pxshadow/go2hx --global``
* ``lix run go2hx ./main.go`` or ``lix run go2hx github.com/tidwall/btree``


# Code Overview

* The packages are generated by arguments and flags, and exported out from the Go side by json.
* The Haxe side then reads the exported data and begins typing up the data into TypeDefinitions, Fields, and Exprs.
* The types are generated into Haxe files.
* The generated code uses the stdgo package, that contains the basic types, builtin functions, and some macro magic.
