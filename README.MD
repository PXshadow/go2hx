go2hx
==========
The Go to Haxe transpiler

**warning:** *experimental and still very much a work in progress.*

# Getting started
* if you don't have Golang download it [here](https://golang.org/dl/)
* if you don't have lix run: ``npm install lix -g``
* ``lix run go2hx ./main.go`` or ``lix run go2hx github.com/tidwall/btree``

# Roadmap

* Finish writing go's core standard library in haxe e.g strconv, strings, utf8, os, net, encoding, a lot of crypto.
* Go routines using haxe 4.2's coroutines.
* Pass the [test suite](https://github.com/pxshadow/go2hxtest)

# Code Overview

* The packages are generated by arguments and flags, and exported out from the Go side by either json/bson.
* The Haxe side then reads the exported data and begins typing up the data into TypeDefinitions, Fields and Exprs.
* The types are post processed.
* The types are then generated into Haxe files.

# Code Structure

* stdgo: go's standard library written in haxe (only the low level is written i.e uses internal or syscall with certain exceptions). stdgo. stdgo/Go.hx class holds the internal language functionality that Haxe does not have (example: c style for loops, multi returns). stdgo/Builtin.hx holds the built in functions that go has such as len, cap, make.
* export.go: called go4x as the name implies is Go code for Haxe usage, go2hx passes command line arguments to it such as flags and library paths and in return go4hx produces an export.bson/json that go2hx uses to type, processes and then generate Haxe files.
* src: The Haxe side of the tool that handles the user input and does the typing, processing and generation from the output data by go4hx (export.bson/json)
